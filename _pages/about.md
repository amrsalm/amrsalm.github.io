About Me
======

Hello, I'm Amr Salem, a master’s student in Biostatistics and Applied Mathematics with a focus on statistical genomics and healthcare data science. I am currently working as a research assistant with Dr. Chen-Han Wilfred Wu at the Urogenetics Lab, where I contribute to groundbreaking research in kidney stone disease. My work in the lab centers on analyzing the natural history of kidney stone progression using deep learning methods and statistical analysis to understand patient trajectories over time. By exploring these longitudinal patterns, we aim to shed light on risk factors and disease evolution, ultimately contributing to improved prevention and treatment strategies.

Capstone Project
------
My capstone project focuses on developing a **deep learning-based Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)** model to assess genetic predispositions for various health outcomes. This work integrates large-scale genomic data with advanced machine learning techniques to refine PRS models, making them more accurate and adaptable across different populations. Utilizing tools like Hail, Python, and high-performance computing resources, I am working to create models that can serve as a foundation for personalized healthcare by predicting individual disease risk with greater precision. This project reflects my broader goal of advancing machine learning applications in genomics and healthcare.

Research Interests
------
My primary research interests lie in **machine learning**, **statistical genomics**, and **personalized medicine**. I am particularly focused on leveraging deep learning and graph neural networks to enhance predictive modeling in healthcare. In addition to my capstone, I am developing an attention-based Graph Neural Network (GNN) model to improve PRS predictions. 

I am also interested in **natural language processing** (NLP) applications within healthcare, such as my project *ClinQuest*, an NLP tool combining MedSpaCy with machine learning models to map patient symptoms to ICD-10 codes, making clinical data more accessible and actionable for providers.

Passions Beyond Academics
======

Outside of the classroom, I have a range of interests that keep me creatively and physically engaged. I’m passionate about **science communication and teaching** and enjoy sharing complex ideas in accessible ways, whether through mentoring, tutoring, or giving presentations. Bringing science to a broader audience is something I find incredibly fulfilling.

I'm also deeply into **indie games**—both playing and sometimes developing them as a side hobby, where I experiment with coding and game design. Fitness has become a big part of my routine as I work toward my health goals, providing a perfect balance to my academic life.

In addition, I’m a fan of **classic movies**, especially for their storytelling and cinematography. A couple of my favorites are *12 Angry Men* and *Casablanca*. These films offer timeless lessons in human character and resilience that inspire me in both life and work.


Looking Ahead
------
My academic journey continues as I prepare for a PhD focused on biostatistics and machine learning in epidemiology and statistical genomics. I am driven by the potential of genomics and AI to reshape healthcare and am excited to contribute to these fields through research and collaboration.
