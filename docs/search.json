    "text": "1 The Responsibility of Data Sharing in Modern Science\nOne of the most compelling arguments made in How to Be a Modern Scientist is that the debate over whether data should be shared is over—the real question now is how to do it effectively. The need for transparency, reproducibility, and open access to scientific data has been cemented by scandals like the Potti and Reinhart/Rogoff cases, where flawed and unreproducible research led to massive consequences. Yet, despite the importance of data sharing, the transition to a fully open scientific ecosystem remains rough, mainly due to technical, cultural, and economic barriers.\n\n\n2 The Challenges of Data Sharing\nThe book makes an excellent point that many researchers, even in data-heavy fields like genomics, lack proper training in handling and organizing data. Having worked in biostatistics, I have seen this firsthand—datasets riddled with inconsistencies, missing metadata, and cryptic file names that make reproducibility nearly impossible. While computational tools exist to clean and document data efficiently, there is little incentive for researchers to invest time in this unless explicitly required.\nBeyond technical challenges, there is also a cultural problem—scientific career incentives still prioritize novelty over reproducibility. Researchers who spend years generating a valuable dataset may be hesitant to share it immediately because they want to maximize their own publications before others use their data. The book suggests that data generators should receive more formal credit beyond citations, which I think is a crucial idea. If datasets had the same prestige as high-impact papers, scientists would be more motivated to share their work openly rather than keeping it behind closed doors.\n\n\n3 Data Sharing and the Public Good\nDespite these challenges, the argument for data sharing is clear: it benefits science as a whole rather than just individual careers. The potential for collaborative discovery is enormous when data is openly accessible. In my work with genomics and statistical modeling, I have relied on public datasets to train and validate machine learning models. Without them, progress in personalized medicine and risk prediction would be significantly slower.\nYet, it’s surprising how many studies are published without clear, accessible data. I have often come across papers where the data is either poorly documented, hidden behind paywalls, or simply unavailable. This creates a major barrier to reproducibility—one of the most fundamental principles of science. A study should not just be believed; it should be tested and verified by others.\nStriking a Balance: Protecting Data Generators While Promoting Openness The book makes an important distinction between symbiotic vs. parasitic research practices—should researchers who use someone else’s data always be required to collaborate with the original authors? In an ideal world, collaboration fosters stronger science. But in reality, imposing strict rules on data use can discourage sharing. Instead of viewing independent data reanalysis as “parasitic,” we should see it as a way to strengthen scientific claims.\nThat being said, I understand why many researchers hesitate to release data. If a scientist spends years collecting an exceptional dataset, only for someone else to publish multiple high-impact papers using it, the original researcher’s contributions may be overshadowed. This is where I think How to Be a Modern Scientist offers a valuable solution—rewarding data generators more formally, perhaps through funding incentives or specific data-generation citations that weigh as heavily as primary publications.\n#Final Thoughts: Data Sharing as a Duty In fields like genomics, climate science, and public health, the consequences of hoarding data can be severe. The COVID-19 pandemic showed how important open data is for global scientific collaboration. When researchers across the world shared viral genome sequences in real-time, it led to the rapid development of vaccines. But in other areas of research, the reluctance to share data is still slowing down progress.\nAs someone working in biostatistics, I see data sharing as both a practical necessity and an ethical obligation. The more accessible and well-documented our datasets are, the faster we can advance science. But we must also rethink how we credit and reward those who generate data, ensuring that transparency benefits not just science, but also the scientists behind it."

Under the guidance of Dr. Anirban Mondal, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze genotypic data from 60 individuals, encompassing over 400 SNPs identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The model achieved an accuracy of 75% and an ROC-AUC of 0.8125, providing promising insights into genetic predispositions to kidney stones.\nA major challenge was working with a relatively small dataset, which required careful optimization of model parameters and validation techniques to ensure robust predictions. This experience honed my ability to combine biological context with computational tools, paving the way for future research involving larger datasets and integration of clinical features.\n\n\nDisease Course of Kidney Stones\nThis project investigates the disease course of kidney stones, focusing on the factors influencing their progression and recurrence. By leveraging clinical and genomic data, we aim to develop predictive models that can assist in tailoring treatment strategies for patients. My contributions include data preprocessing, feature selection, and implementing machine learning pipelines to identify key predictors. This research has the potential to inform more personalized approaches to managing kidney stone disease.\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
