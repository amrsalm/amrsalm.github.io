    "text": "Experience\n\nWu Lab at Case Western Reserve University (2022–Present)\nAt the Wu Lab, I have been working on applying data science to better understand and improve the management of kidney stone disease. My projects involve integrating computational and statistical methods to analyze large-scale genomic datasets, with the goal of identifying patterns and predictors in the disease’s progression and recurrence. This work has deepened my understanding of precision medicine and the application of biostatistics in translational research.\n\n\nGillani Lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (Starting Summer 2025)\nThe Gillani Lab is dedicated to advancing pediatric, adolescent, and young adult cancer care through innovative computational biology approaches. Their mission is to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of germline genetics and tumor genomics in pediatric cancer, with the goal of informing novel management strategies.\nI am excited to join this dynamic team and contribute to their vision of improving pediatric cancer care using cutting-edge computational biology."

    "text": "Research Projects\n\nPredicting Kidney Stone Risk Using Genomic Data\nThis project aimed to predict kidney stone susceptibility using genomic data. Under the guidance of Dr. Anirban Mondal, I developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to analyze genotypic data from 60 individuals, encompassing over 400 SNPs identified from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The model achieved an accuracy of 75% and an ROC-AUC of 0.8125, providing promising insights into genetic predispositions to kidney stones.\nA major challenge was working with a relatively small dataset, which required careful optimization of model parameters and validation techniques to ensure robust predictions. This experience honed my ability to combine biological context with computational tools, paving the way for future research involving larger datasets and integration of clinical features.\n\n\nDisease Course of Kidney Stones\nThis project investigates the disease course of kidney stones, focusing on the factors influencing their progression and recurrence. By leveraging clinical and genomic data, we aim to develop predictive models that can assist in tailoring treatment strategies for patients. My contributions include data preprocessing, feature selection, and implementing machine learning pipelines to identify key predictors. This research has the potential to inform more personalized approaches to managing kidney stone disease.\n\n\nView the tutorial for this template (+ download link)"
